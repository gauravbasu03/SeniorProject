Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Nice work on the breakdown.  The components are well-thought-out and make
   sense in context of the application.  This will be a sophisticated effort
   and application so it's good that you have set it up with parts that can
   be tailored for appropriate scope.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   For something this sophisticated, your requirements need to be specific.
   For example, you have:

      5.3.1.1 The system shall retrieve real estate listings from the Zillow
              API.
      5.3.1.2 The system shall display property details including price,
              location, and square footage.

   This should actually be a 'shall' and a 'will' as follows:

      5.3.1.1 The system shall retrieve real estate listings from the Zillow
              API.
              In the event that the Zillow API is not available when queried
              The system will display an error message to that effect.
      5.3.1.2 The system shall display property details obtained from the
              Zillow API.
              Property details will include but not be limited to:
                 * price
                 * location
                 * square footage

   As you can see, you will need several more than two requirements for each
   of the CSC/CSU modules.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   These are good!  You've obviously thought about this...

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Just a question/observation, but will this NOT run on a Mac with M1/M2/M3
   processor? You specifiy Intel only...

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus


Overall, a fine job and a good start.  Make the changes as described by the
end of the semester for full credit on this document.

Good work!
