Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Thrive
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
This is a very impressive project which has a LOT of parts.  It is a pretty
sweeping scope for a one-semester project.  My recommendation would be for
the team to sit down and prioritize all the sections to decide what parts to
consider a "successful" project, then add the rest as "stretch goals" which
can be added as time permits.

One thing I noticed, in the first paragraph, you refer to your project as
"Thrive" a couple of times, but you also seem to call it "Financial
Navigator" in one spot.  Maybe a more deliberate read-through before you
commit would be in order?

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
Excellent presentation!  I really like the blue background, a nice neutral
color.  The graphics are descriptive and nice to look at, reinforcing the
text on the slide.  You all talked about the different segments and all
seemed to have straight who would say what.  Most everyone faced the room
and not the slides, too.  Well done!


Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.
