I see you have filled out the architectural design section as well for this
submission ~ good!  There are some sections that are a bit light on content,
and here is the revised evaluation:

SDD: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Major software components section
      You need more description of what each of these components is for.  It
      is supposed to be a listing with a brief description of each item.

   Major software interactions section
      This is also supposed to have at least a *little* more detail than a
      simple list.

   Architectural design diagrams section
      This is the best part of the architectural section, although the label
      of each diagram doesn't stay with the diagram itself.  You should try
      to get that to work on your next effort.  Also, the labels are not the
      actual type of the diagram.  Both of your drawings are really more of
      a 'data flow' diagram.  A 'use case' diagram is something specific as
      you can see from my web page or from an Internet search for "Use case
      diagram".  Here's an example:
