======================

SUMMARY:
   Excellent synopsis of the article.  You describe all the main points and
   give the reader enough detail so that the article's statements are clear.
   The specifics from the article are helpful to further define your main
   points.

CRITICAL THINKING:
   Relation to S/W engineering:
      Nice work on this section as well.  You have given me something to
      consider with your description of failures in systems integration and
      communication, and with your points about protecting the privacy of
      users, particularly with vulnerable user populations.

   Thoughts/opinions presented:
      I also like the way you meld the ValuJet article with this one and
      state the four things on which to focus.
